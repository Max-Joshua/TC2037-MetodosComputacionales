_This project parses JSON files into HTML files_



## Description
---

The purpose of this work is to sequentially apply lexical highlighting to multiple source files, which are contained in one or more nested directories. The implementation of this project was carried out in parallel with the purpose of taking advantage of the multiple cores that current computer equipment has.



## Solution to a problem
---

The life of a programmer can become complicated with the massive handling of information within electronic devices. It is because of this that you must have the security of being able to read and interpret different complex data structures quickly and efficiently with the aim of being able to create and show new processes in the handling of information and algorithms.

JSON files have become more widely used in the programming world over the last few years due to their ease of creation as well as readability. It is thanks to this, that the fact of having a tool capable of ordering, visualizing and interpreting these documents in a simple way, would reduce work times in procedures in which the handling of large-caliber data is required.

Within the tests carried out in this project, 4 load times are presented in which the program received, interpreted and decoded in the syntax highlighter attached to its respective HTML. The respective times in which the processes were carried out are as follows:


    Archivo Test_files/ex1.json se creo en (43ms)

    Archivo Test_files/ex3.json se creo en (44ms)
    
    Archivo Test_files/ex2.json se creo en (44ms)
    
    Archivo Test_files/ex4.json se creo en (44ms)



## Conclusions
---

The limitations that this project presents in terms of ethical issues are very few, speaking from a personal point of view, since these applications allow easy interaction between humans and computers, making the population that is interested in knowing more about programming you can get closer by understanding what they are perceiving.

Likewise, this project facilitates the visualization of a computerized environment in which people can become confused and stressed when seeing letters not assigned by color; Otherwise, which is intended to be shown in this work.
